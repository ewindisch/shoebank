Allen Edmonds Shoebank scraper
------------------------------

Scrapes the Allen Edmonds shoebank...

With Docker installed, you can download inventory and generate reports with:

 $ ./compare generate


To print the reports without redownloading inventory:

 $ ./compare

Note that if 'generate' is called, it compares against the previously
downloaded inventory. Inventory is updated daily, so the previous
inventory is stored as "yesterday.csv".

Much could be done to improve how the CSV files are saved and compared.

Issues:
--------

- Presently, the entire shoebank database is downloaded. This is not
  efficient for users looking for a single size and width.
- My personal shoe size is hard-coded into the compare script. Users
  will need to change this.
